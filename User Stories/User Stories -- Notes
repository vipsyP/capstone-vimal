Helps shift focus from writing about requirements to discussing them.


A series of conversations about the desired functionality


Short, Simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of people


*As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >*
 
 
Usually written on sticky notes and arranged on walls -- therefore, facilitate discussions

*Large user stories are generally known as epics. 
	
	
	Detail can be added to user stories in two ways:


		1. Can be split into smaller stories.
		Ex. As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive. 
		~> As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.
		~> As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.

		
		2. By adding “conditions of satisfaction.”
		Ex As a vice president of marketing, I want to select a holiday season to be used when reviewing the performance of past advertising campaigns so that I can identify profitable ones.
		~>Make sure it works with major retail holidays: Christmas, Easter, President’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Labor Day, New Year’s Day.
		~>Holiday seasons can be set from one holiday to the next (such as Thanksgiving to Christmas).
		~>Holiday seasons can be set to be a number of days prior to the holiday.
